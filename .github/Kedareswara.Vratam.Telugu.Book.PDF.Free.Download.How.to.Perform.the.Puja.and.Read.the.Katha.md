## What is Kedareswara Vratam?
 
Kedareswara Vratam is a vrata puja that worships Lord Shiva as Kedareswar, who is said to be the supreme form of Shiva. The word Kedara means a mountain peak, and it refers to Mount Kailash, where Shiva resides with his consort Parvati. The legend behind this vratam is that once Parvati got angry with Shiva for favoring a rishi named Birungi who only worshipped Shiva and ignored her. She cursed him to lose his power and left Kailash for earth. Shiva then gave Birungi a stick to support himself and asked him to perform a vratam in his name. Birungi did so and regained his power. Parvati also realized her mistake and returned to Shiva after performing the same vratam. Since then, Kedareswara Vratam is observed by devotees who seek the blessings of Shiva and Parvati.
